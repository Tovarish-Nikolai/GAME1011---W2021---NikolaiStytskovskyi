 You go through the door and enter your hallway. A thought glances in your head:
 People say, if you can traverse your living space with your eyes closed,
 it means that you have a severe case of routines.
 You struggle to remember last time you reached your hands out when the lights went out,
 let alone use a light on your phone.
