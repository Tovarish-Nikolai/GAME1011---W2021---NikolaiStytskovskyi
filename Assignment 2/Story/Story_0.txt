 It was a boring sunny Saturday. As boring, in fact, as all the other boring days of the week.
 You woke up, brush your teeth, brew yourself a hot cup of coffee and hop behind your desktop.
 Scroll a forum, work a bit, eat cereal and watch MePipe, work a bit, toilet, work a bit, get distracted by a message...
 Week to week, month to month, year to year. Your boring routine for the boring day never changes.
 You finally came to realise that this isn't what you've always dreamt of. You remember a phrase...
 " If you wish hard enough, your wishes will come true! Now, what can you wish more than a cup of hot coffee?
  Wish for yours today, at 555-555... "
 What if that's actually it? Not the lame promo, but the wishing thing?
 You wish to get out of your routine...
