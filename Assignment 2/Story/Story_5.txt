 And there you have it in your hands. 
 An object of adoration, a product of love and a result of making your wishes come true.
 A sandwich...
 You haven't eaten one in so long that you struggle to remember neither the taste or the texture.
 "So, this is how it feels.." - you think, "this is how it feels to do something different".
 "It feels fun, I need to do it more often. How about instead of coffee I go for tea next morning?".
 With a feeling of accomplishment in your body and nice thoughts in your head, you walk back to your room.
