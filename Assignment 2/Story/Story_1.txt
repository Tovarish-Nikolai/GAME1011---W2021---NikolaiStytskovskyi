 It was a boring sunny Sunday. As boring, in fact, as all the other boring days of the week.

 Well, it means that you have to take matter into your own hands. "Let's start with something small", you think.
 How about, hmm, maybe a sandwich instead of cereal? It ain't much, but is a change afterall..
